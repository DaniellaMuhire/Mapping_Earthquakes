# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Project Overview

In this project, we build insightful data visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes from around the world. We create interactive maps using GeoJSON data from the U.S Geological Survey website. 

We do so by traversing and retrieving the earthquake data using JavaScript, the D3 and leaflet libraries and plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request.
